# My very own scaffolding project

There's a lot of stuff for scaffolding a project. I use bower, grunt and so, you know, it's a shame I don't choose [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) for scaffolding.

I tried to understand the best practice to interact with Yeoman and found 3 way:

* I can use an existing generator (in fact, I did the first time) and customize my needs after the scaffolding process
* I can fork an existing generator
* I can create my own generator

Sadly I'm too dumb to fork/create my own generator. Or I don't have time by now. Or I'm too lazy.

So I take the most advanced Gruntfile I have (the one edited after yeoman-webapp) and some other stuff (like folder structure) and place here for further reference. I promise to my *future me* that this can become a yeoman generator. I will do this in the near future. I will.

## How to use

Install everything you need with:

`npm install`

and then

`bower install`

and then start work on your project.
